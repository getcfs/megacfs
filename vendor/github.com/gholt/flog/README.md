# Flog
## Development Repository

**Experimental: No stable version of this package yet exists; it is still in
early development.**

Package flog provides a logging facility with the usual syslog-style levels
of Critical, Error, Warning, Info, and Debug. It just uses os.Stderr and
os.Stdout by default, and it's mostly here to provide a quick, easy, yet
replaceable way to do logging.

This is the latest development area for the package.  
Eventually a stable version of the package will be established but, for now,
all things about this package are subject to change.
