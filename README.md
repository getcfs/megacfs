# megacfs

This is megalithic code repository for the CFS (Cloud File System) project.

The project is still in pre-release development stages.

The [DEV ENV HOW TO][DEVENVHOWTO.md] is a good start if you'd like to try things out and work on the code.

There is not much documentation at this time, but the [GoDoc code documentation][https://godoc.org/github.com/getcfs/megacfs] may help some. And there is also some documentation on the [Client application][https://github.com/gholt/megacfs/blob/master/cfs/README.md], the [Server application][https://github.com/gholt/megacfs/blob/master/cfsd/README.md], and the [Formic service][https://github.com/gholt/megacfs/blob/master/formic/server/README.md].
